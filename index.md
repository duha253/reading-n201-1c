## HTML  Structure:

HTML Basics: Elements, Tags, and Document Structure 
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the basic structural element that is used to create webpages. HTML is a markup language, which means that it is used to “mark up” the content within a document, in this case a webpage, with structural and semantic information that tells a browser how to display a page. When an HTML document is loaded by a web browser, the browser uses the HTML tags that have marked up the document to render the page’s content.

There are three types of code that make up a basic website page. HTML governs the structural elements, CSS styles those elements, and JavaScript enables dynamic interaction between those elements.


**Elements and Tags**
HTML elements and tags work together to mark up content. HTML elements indicate the purpose of a tag and tags indicate the beginning and the end of an element.

The letter “p” represents the paragraph element. In this example, <p> is an opening tag that tells the browser that the content that follows it is a paragraph. The slash in the second tag, </p>, indicates that it is a closing tag that tells the browser that the paragraph element is ending and that any content that appears after it is not part of the paragraph. You may encounter serious display issues if you don’t remember to “close” each tag because the browser will interpret this pattern as meaning that the element identified by the opening tag should continue for the rest of the page.


### Introduction to the structure of an HTML document An HTML 4  document is composed of three parts:

1. a line containing HTML version information,

2. a declarative header section (delimited by the HEAD element),

3. a body, which contains the document's actual content. The body may be implemented by the BODY element or the FRAMESET element.
White space (spaces, newlines, tabs, and comments) may appear before or after each section. Sections 2 and 3 should be delimited by the HTML element.

 ### Typical Document Scenario
A typical document will not be a blank, minimum document. A typical document might contain comments, headers, footers, footnotes, and endnotes, for example. Each of these additional parts is contained within the zip package of the wordprocessing document.

The following figure shows many of the parts that you would find in a typical document.

## ⦁	Summary STRUCTURE
a.	 HTML pages are text documents.
b.	HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
c.	 Tags are often referred to as elements.
d.	 Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
e.	 Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
f.	 Attributes require a name and a value.
g.	 To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go
